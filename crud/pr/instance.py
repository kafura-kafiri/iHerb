A good multi-vitamin/mineral nutritional supplement could be considered "dietary insurance" to be certain all of the essential nutrients are being consumed on a daily basis. Even greater health benefits can be realized when a healthy diet is being eaten in addition to taking a multi-vitamin/mineral supplement.''',
