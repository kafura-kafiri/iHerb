               <p>Did you like a natural product you’ve tried? Give it 4 or 5 stars. Did the product not meet
                  expectations? Give it a lower rating. Then, explain what you liked or didn’t like about the product.
                  Be as complete and accurate as possible to help others with their purchasing decisions.</p>

               <p>It’s your page. Personalize it with a photo and profile. Example: Tami’s Product Reviews. “I am a
                  product manager and native of Tokyo. I use a variety of natural products and have ordered from iHerb
                  since 2007.” You can even feature up to four of your favorite products and create a “social media hub”
                  for sharing with others.</p>
