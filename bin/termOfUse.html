                              check (as the case may be). Our obligation is limited to a maximum of three months of
                              Rewards, calculated based on your Rewards for the month prior to the month in which the

                           <p>We appreciate the "word of mouth" advertising our customers provide and reward you for
                              introducing your relatives and friends to iHerb. Rewards are accumulated when others use
                              your email address or Rewards Code to place an order. Rewards can be used towards
                              purchases on iHerb.com or can be redeemed for cash at a specific accumulation amount.</p>
                           <p>For the referral payment schedule and information on the iHerb Rewards Program, visit our

                           <p>When you receive Rewards, simply log into your iHerb account and shop as you normally
                              would. Once you begin adding items to your shopping cart, you will see available Rewards
                              being automatically subtracted from your subtotal, assuming you have accepted the most
                              recent Agreement. If you have not accepted the most recent Agreement, then no Rewards will
                              be available for use until such time as the most recent Agreement has been accepted.
                              Unused Rewards expire 180 days after the date when they are posted in your iHerb
                              account.</p>
                           <p>On the last day of each month, any account holder with a specific amount in Rewards may
                              elect to “cash out” and receive payment if they provide tax ID information to iHerb.
                              Reward amounts below a specific threshold will be rolled over to next month. You will be
                              responsible for any and all tax liability arising from any Rewards you accumulate under
                              the Rewards Program.</p>
                           <p>Your Rewards Code is valid for use by all new or existing customers that you refer to
                              iHerb. To ensure that you don’t lose credit from referrals, iHerb applies available
                              Rewards automatically to your personal purchases, subject to acceptance of this
                              Agreement.</p>
                           <p>Qualifying orders placed with referral links will be credited to your Rewards Account. We

                              of Use. We will track qualifying orders for reporting, advertising, and fee accrual, and
                              make those available to your reports.</p>

                              accumulate under the Rewards Program. We are obligated by United States federal law to
                              obtain tax information from Rewards Program participants who are United States citizens or
                              United States residents (W-9) and from Rewards Program participants who are not United
                              States citizens or residents but whose businesses are taxable in the United States
                              (W8-ECI). If we believe you are a Rewards Program participant from whom we are obligated
                              to obtain tax information and you do not provide this information to us after we have
                              requested it, we may withhold your Rewards until you provide this information or otherwise
                              satisfy us that you are not a person from whom we are required to obtain tax information.
                              For US citizens or residents, information about submitting tax information is available on

                              Likewise, your blog, website or social media pages may not resemble the Site or include

                           <p>You may also email your iHerb Rewards Code or send a text message to friends and family.
                              In doing so, you represent and warrant that you will not engage in and/or facilitate
                              spamming, unsolicited commercial email or otherwise fail to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act

                           <p>You may not purchase or use domain or subdomain names that include the word “iHerb” or

                              applications, so you may not create or utilize any client side application (browser

                              may not integrate and/or use our app in any way. Likewise, you are not permitted to
                              participate in any advertising as the Rewards Program is not intended for commercial

                           <p>Your iHerb MyPage Profile is intended to provide some non-personal background information
                              (e.g. your favorite hobby) to other customers. This helps others better understand the
                              perspective of your review, not just whether you liked or did not like the product. For
                              example, a person aged 25 using a product designed for someone over the age of 50 probably
                              won’t have the same product experience.</p>
                           <p>Your iHerb MyPage Profile should not include iHerb Rewards Codes, mention discounts, URLs
                              or contain content that promotes the Rewards Program unless otherwise provided by
                              iHerb.</p>
                           <p>Your MyPage Profile Link Name should not mislead or misrepresent yourself to others.
                              Phrases including, but not limited to “click me, open me, save" or "first-time customers”
                              are not appropriate for this section. Instead, please select a MyPage Profile Link Name
                              that applies to your personality, location or something unique about you -- such as
                              "Aloha-Bob” or “Sarah-Skydiver.”</p>

                        <h2>Agreement:</h2>
                        <p>This Agreement constitutes the only Agreement between us and you with respect to the subject
                           matter of this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous Agreements,
                           representations, warranties and understandings, written or oral, with respect to the subject

                           any reason, that provision will be severed from this Agreement and the remainder of this
                           Agreement will remain in force. When used in this Agreement, the term "including" will be
                           deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". </p>

                        <p>All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this
                           Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the
                           State of California, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law.</p>
                        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and iHerb Entities agree to arbitrate any
                           controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement. </p>
                        <p>YOU AND IHERB ENTITIES EXPRESSLY AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING
                           OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT IN YOUR AND ITS/THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES,
                           AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
                           THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT
                           OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. </p>
                        <p>The mutual promise by you and iHerb Entities to arbitrate any and all disputes, and to do so
                           on an individual basis, rather than to litigate before the courts or other bodies, provides
                           the mutual consideration for this agreement to arbitrate. </p>
                        <p>Either party may exercise the right to arbitrate by providing the other party with written
                           notice of any and all claims forming the basis of such right in sufficient detail to inform
                           the other party of the substance of such claims. In no event shall the request for
                           arbitration be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based
                           on such claims would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>
                        <p>The arbitration will be conducted in Riverside County, California by a single neutral
                           arbitrator and in accordance with the then current rules for resolution of disputes of the
                           American Arbitration Association (AAA) (available on line at www.adr.org). The parties are
                           entitled to representation by an attorney or other representative of their choosing. The
                           parties agree to abide by and perform any award rendered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator
                           shall issue the award in writing and therein state the essential findings and conclusions on
                           which the award is based. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having
                           jurisdiction thereof.</p>
                        <p>You and iHerb Entities shall bear the costs of the arbitrator, forum and filing fees on an
                           equal basis. The prevailing party, as determined by the arbitrator, shall be entitled to an
                           award of its reasonable attorney fees. </p>

                           will not constitute a waiver of such term and will not be considered a waiver or limit that
                           party's right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of
                           this Agreement. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim of

                           filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or will be permanently
                           barred. The "Liability Disclaimer" provisions of this Agreement are for the benefit of iHerb
                           Entities as defined herein, and each of these individuals or entities shall have the right to
